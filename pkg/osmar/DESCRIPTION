Description: This package imports the (Spatial and Non-Spatial) Data of OpenStreetMap into objects of R by using the OSM-API v0.6. For now it is reduced on using various commands of type "GET", like getting data of an explicit element or a region defined by coordinates. It also includes some methods on working with the newly created objects.
