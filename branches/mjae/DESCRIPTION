Description: This package imports the (Spatial and
    Non-Spatial) Data of OpenStreetMap into objects of R by
    using the OSM-API v0.6. For now it is reduced on using
    various commands of type "GET", like getting data of an
    explicit element or a region defined by coordinates. It
    also includes some methods on working with the newly
    created objects.
